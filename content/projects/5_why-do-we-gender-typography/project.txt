As one of the most ubiquitous pieces of design in our lives, typefaces come to us at the end of a long research and development cycle that few of us ever get to see.

In this process, the values and tastes of a given society are embedded in a typeface, and this is where assumptions about gender can carry into type â€” be it consciously or unconsciously.
